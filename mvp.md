MVP Core User Flows:

UMKM (Seller) Flow:
Registers an account.
Creates a simple profile/storefront.
Lists a product for sale.
Receives inquiries from buyers.
Buyer Flow:
Browses/searches for products.
Views product details.
Contacts the seller to inquire/arrange a purchase.
MVP Feature Set:

1. User Authentication:
* [ ] UMKM Registration: Email/Password. Collect Business Name, a simple description, contact (WhatsApp number is crucial), and general area in Bekasi (e.g., dropdown of Kecamatan).
* [ ] Buyer Registration (Optional or Simplified): Buyers might be able to browse without registering. Registration (Email/Password) required only to contact sellers. This lowers the barrier for buyers.
* [ ] Login System.

2. UMKM Profile/Storefront (Simplified):
* [ ] Display Business Name, description, contact info, general location.
* [ ] List of products posted by this UMKM.

3. Product Listing (for UMKM):
* [ ] Simple Form:
* Product Title
* Product Description (textarea)
* Price (IDR)
* Category (pre-defined, simple dropdown list, e.g., Makanan & Minuman, Pakaian, Kerajinan, Jasa, Elektronik, etc. Keep this list small and manageable for MVP).
* Product Photos (ability to upload 1-3 images).
* Condition (New/Used dropdown).
* [ ] Basic Listing Management: Ability for UMKM to view, edit, or delete their own listings. Mark as "Sold" (optional for MVP, can just be deleted).

4. Product Discovery (for Buyers):
* [ ] Homepage Feed: Display recently listed products.
* [ ] Basic Search: By keywords in Product Title and Description.
* [ ] Category Browsing: Click on a category to see all products in it.
* [ ] Product Detail Page: Shows all product info (title, description, price, photos, category, seller info with contact button).

5. Communication:
* [ ] "Contact Seller" Button:
* Option A (Simplest MVP): This button reveals the seller's WhatsApp number (collected during registration) and maybe has a pre-filled message template like "Halo, saya tertarik dengan produk [Nama Produk] Anda di BekasiUMKMConnect." All communication and transaction happens outside the platform.
* Option B (Slightly More Complex but Better): Basic in-app messaging between buyer and seller. This keeps users on the platform and allows you to potentially gather more data later. If you choose this, it needs to be very simple for MVP.

6. Very Basic Admin Panel (for you):
* [ ] Ability to view users.
* [ ] Ability to view and delete inappropriate listings (manual moderation).

AI Integration for MVP: NONE (or EXTREMELY minimal)

For a true MVP, I strongly recommend launching without any AI features first.
Why?
Focus: You need to validate the core marketplace functionality. AI adds complexity, development time, and potential cost.
Data: AI models often need data. You won't have much at launch.
Learn First: See how users interact with the basic platform. This will inform which AI features would be most valuable.
If you absolutely MUST have one tiny AI piece (and have the resources/skill):
Perhaps an AI-powered "bad word filter" for product descriptions or titles to assist manual moderation. But even this can be done with simple keyword lists initially.
Technology Stack Considerations (Keep it simple for MVP):

Frontend: A simple web application (React, Vue, Svelte, or even server-rendered like Next.js/Nuxt.js if your backend framework supports it well). Ensure it's mobile-responsive.
Backend: Node.js (Express/NestJS), Python (Django/Flask), Ruby on Rails. Choose what you/your team are most comfortable with for speed.
Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL are solid relational choices. MongoDB (NoSQL) could also work.
Image Storage: Cloud storage like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Cloudinary (has a generous free tier for images).
Deployment: Vercel (great for Next.js/React), Netlify, Heroku, or basic cloud VMs.
What's NOT in the MVP (To be added later):

Advanced search filters (price range, specific Bekasi sub-location, ratings).
Integrated payments or shopping cart.
Ratings and reviews system.
User-to-user following.
Sophisticated seller dashboards with analytics.
Native mobile apps (focus on responsive web first).
Community forums.
Most AI features (recommendations, smart categorization, chatbots, etc.).
UMKM verification process (beyond basic info).
Key MVP Goal: Launch quickly, get feedback from real Bekasi UMKM and buyers, and iterate.

Next Steps After Defining MVP Features:

Choose your tech stack.
Design basic UI/UX wireframes. Keep them clean and functional.
Start building!
Plan your launch strategy: How will you get the first 10-20 UMKM to list? How will you get the first 50-100 buyers to browse? (Local Facebook groups, direct outreach, partnerships with local community leaders in Bekasi).
For AI features:
Start with the basics.
Focus on getting feedback from users.
If you have time, build a simple AI-powered chatbot that can answer basic questions (e.g., "How do I list a product?" or "What is your return policy?").
